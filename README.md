Contains cards of anime archetypes made by me

# Archetype List

### Machikado Mazoku

The plan was to make an archetype that takes the idea that everything on that manga is connected, that's why the effects are around being linked or not, though right now it's mostly a mesh of effects from other link archetypes. I'm probably going to rework this arch sometime in the future.

### Re: Zero (WIP)

This archetype was made to be played for fun rather than being competitively, but even that I tried to give them a clear play style and make groups of cards that could support each other. Two clear groups for now are magic beast and the witch cult.
